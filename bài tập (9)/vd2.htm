<h1>The Main Languages of the Web</h1>

<p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page, and consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.</p>

<hr>

<p>CSS is a language that describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work, because it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
